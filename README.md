# SendScriptWhatsApp

> Code to send the entire script of Shrek, Bee Movie, and others via WhatsApp Web quickly and automatically. It is often used to annoy friends, family, and even enemies.

## How it works

- [Shrek](https://github.com/sneycampos/SendScriptWhatsApp/blob/main/scripts/shrek.js)
- [Bee Movie](https://github.com/sneycampos/SendScriptWhatsApp/blob/main/scripts/bee.js)
- [All scripts](https://github.com/sneycampos/SendScriptWhatsApp/scripts)

## Usage

- Open [shrek.js](https://github.com/sneycampos/SendScriptWhatsApp/blob/main/scripts/shrek.js) or any other available script
- Copy the entire content (click RAW to view the full code)
- In WhatsApp Web, open the browser console (F12 or Right Click > Inspect)
- Paste the code into the console and press Enter

| ⚠️ Important Notice! In the most recent versions of Google Chrome, pasting any script into the Console is being blocked.          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ***To bypass this issue, the developer console expects a textual confirmation by typing "allow pasting" in the console.*** | 
| After that, you will be allowed to paste and proceed with the script execution.                                                                           |
