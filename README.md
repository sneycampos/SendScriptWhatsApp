| ⚠️ Important Notice! In the most recent versions of Google Chrome, pasting any script into the Console is being blocked.          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ***To bypass this issue, the developer console expects a textual confirmation by typing "allow pasting" in the console.*** | 
| After that, you will be allowed to paste and proceed with the script execution.                                                                           |
